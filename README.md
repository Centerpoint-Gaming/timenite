Timenite is web app that shows countdowns for Fortnite Seasons and Item Shop resets along with a blog powered by Jekyll.

# Timenite Daily
Timenite Daily is the best way to stay up-to-date with Fortnite updates, it automatically fetches Fortnite's Item Shop every midnight at 00:00 UTC and then constructs and publishes images to Timenite's Instagram, Twitter and Item Shop countdown page automatically. It also constructs another image and posts the number of days left until the next on Fortnite.

# FAQ

Can I embed the countdowns on my live-streams, videos or website?

Feel free to embed any countdown from the site, no credit required either but always appreciated. I've even made it easier to do so, just go to [Timenite Embed](https://timenite.com/embeds) and use the embed codes provided!
