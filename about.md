  <p class="paragraph paragraph-bottom timenite-black is-size-7 pb-4 has-text-centered">*Updated on 5th July 2022.</p>


Timenite is a simple website that I created back in 2019. 

&nbsp;


Back then, the idea was to use my initial web-developement skills to create a simple countdown website so that we didn't have to 
open Fortnite every time to check how long do we have to wait until the next season finally arrives.

&nbsp;

Well, the idea is still the same but as of now, the website also features a blog with content related to Fortnite. 

&nbsp;

The entire code of this website is also open-source and is available on <a href="https://github.com/priyam-raj/timenite" target=_blank>GitHub</a>. This website is currently deployed on Cloudflare Pages.
