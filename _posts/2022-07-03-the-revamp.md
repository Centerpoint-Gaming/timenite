> ![New Timenite](/media/1.png)

Back in 2019 when I made this website as just a fun and simple project,
I did not expect so much users, at all.

&nbsp;

Firstly, I'd like to thank you for being a user of this website and
if you've used my creator code **pri**.

<strong class="is-size-4">Introducing, Timenite v3</strong>

Starting with the new UI, Timenite is also a blog now. 
What you're reading here is the very first blog post in here.

&nbsp;

The reason why I wanted to do this is because for years **Timenite** had been the same 'blue-background'
simple website, this needed an update with its very own style. As I recently finished a UI/UX course, I wanted to
apply that in here.

<strong class="is-size-4">What to expect?</strong>

Expect some articles related to Fortnite from now, I'll try to post once in a while. 
Once again, thank you for reading this. Tbh this post was more of a test to see if things are working fine.

**A word on Embeds**: It'll be back, soon. See you soon!
