Because most of the stuff here as well as on our social media (@timenitedaily) is automated,
we had no idea about the recent change in the Chapter's count. Thanks to Twitter user @Not_Dubs12 for reminding us for the same. 

<br>


It feels extremely early for us to have a new Chapter when it could've just been Chapter 3 Season 5 but it is what it is.

All the social posts as well as on our website, we're now counting down to Chapter 4 Season 1 and not Chapter 3 Season 5.
